Why MongoDB ?
NoSQL architecture is followed by MnogoDB



change port using  ,  --port 5000    arg while running SHELL and SERVER
  . mongod --dbpath data/db --port 5000                                // START server
  . mongo --port 5000                                                  // START shell



For SHELL methods refer   "MongoDB_ShellMethods.txt"



CAP THEOREM
=============
WRITE operation can be in PRIMARY DB only
READ operation can be from any (S ECONDARY(s), PRIMARY)
    - this provides HIGH AVAILABILITY as we have cluster (PRIMARY + SECONDARY) of DATABASES

    - provides EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY

    - provides PARTITION (SHARDING) TOLERANCE
